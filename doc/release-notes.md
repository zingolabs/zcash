Notable changes
===============

Merkle branches removed from wallet
-----------------------------------

Previously, every wallet transaction stored a Merkle branch to prove its
presence in blocks. This wasn't being used for more than an expensive
sanity check. Since 4.5.0, these are no longer stored. When loading a
4.5.0 wallet into an older version, it will automatically rescan to avoid
failed checks.
